# <ins>Heya!

**I'm VeraVeemo, but I am also known as "AVeemo", "Veemo", or "AV"!**

## <ins>About
### Programming
I'm greatly into coding and gaming, and I do a lot of them both! I aim to make projects that will benefit all others, and it's all for free!

I mainly know:
- Python (Main Language)
- Java
- Lua & Luau
- C#
- HTML
- JS (A little bit)

And I use all these with [JetBrains](https://jetbrains.com) products, since all of Microsoft's products suck.

My main organization is "Veemoworks" where I do all my made-for-community projects, I am currently working solo and hoping to grow much bigger in the future!

I also currently work in 3 Roblox Studios ( Wonders of Robloxia, Ban Evasion/M4SSACRE STUDIOS, Evil Within ), and I am pretty good at Roblox scripting, so if you need me to script for you/join your team, hit me up!

### Gaming
I enjoy Shooting, Fighting, and Sandbox games.

Games have gotten boring over time, so I'm stuck with about 3–6 games to play every day, but I play:
- Roblox
- Minecraft
- Persona 3/4/5
- JSAB
- DBFZ

I used to play a lot of games, but ever since I have been trying my hardest to code, I've barely even played games anymore.

### Misc
I don't know what else to put here.

uhh, here's jetbrains helping me and this image for the dash where "3-6" is so you don't call it AI
